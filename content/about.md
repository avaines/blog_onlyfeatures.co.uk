## What is OnlyFeatures?

Cloud providers are constantly launching new features, but not all of them live up to the hype. **OnlyFeatures** is a blog dedicated to testing, breaking, and occasionally praising the latest tools and services from AWS, GCP, Azure, and beyond.

If a cloud provider drops a new feature, we’ll poke at it, stress-test it, and see if it’s actually useful—or just another checkbox in a marketing deck.

## Who’s Behind This?

### **Aiden**

Aiden is a cloud enthusiast, builder, and breaker of things. With a background in cloud engineering and DevOps, he spends too much time experimenting with new cloud services and figuring out what actually works in production. Loves deep dives, weird edge cases, and the occasional rant about bad documentation.

### **Hugh**

Hugh is a tech tinkerer with a knack for pushing new features to their limits. He enjoys automating everything, finding creative ways to use (and misuse) cloud tools, and sharing insights that might save from debugging nightmares.

## What to Expect

- Hands-on testing of new cloud features
- Real-world use cases (and misuses)
- Honest takes—no vendor fluff
- Some inevitable “well, that escalated quickly” moments

If you love messing with new cloud toys (or just want to avoid the ones that suck), **OnlyFeatures** is for you.
